<p>JHC Productions is currently an animated film company, founded by CEO/Founder Jolly Hosmer-Cope and Co-Created by Sam Hansen.<br  />We haven't made any shows or films yet, but we are working on some right now.<br  />Our company currently does not pay employees as we have not made any money, so we hold a volunteer program. If you would like to volunteer please contact <a href="mailto:jolly@jhcproductions.tk">jolly@jhcproductions.tk</a>, or ask for available spots at <a href="mailto:careers@jhcproductions.tk">careers@jhcprooductions.tk</a><br  /> For any other inquiries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:all@jhcproductions.tk">all@jhcproductions.tk</a></p>
